# Lee Saville - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into the module seeking to learn a ton about ruby, building a strong base from which I can continue to learn and achieve in the coming modules. In addition I wanted to gather skills along the way that enable me to learn more in the future.

####Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sabrosaurus/binary_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

(description)

Comments:
* Repo: https://github.com/sabrosaurus/binary_tree
* Test coverage is good for what's been finished
* Not full functionality
* Could use more time breaking functionality into smaller methods

Evaluation Scores:
##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


##### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sabrosaurus/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event reporter is a command line application that allows the user to interact with data from an interactive interface. One can load data from a csv file, search the file by name or attribute, and save the search results to a new csv or export into an html file. Additionally, if the number of search items is under 10, one can ask for district information gotten via the sunlight foundations congress API.

Comments:
* 31 tests
* good separation for logic, understanding for edge casing
* used a class instead of a module, but logic is still separated out
* started some lofty extensions

Evaluation Scores:
#####1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations


#####2. REPL Interface 
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use


#####3. Test-Driven Development 
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests


#####4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty


#####5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#####6. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods


#####7. HTML and Style
* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(intro)

Enigma is a command line application that models its function off the original Enigma machine created at Bletchley Park. It encrypts and decrypts messages based on a generated key and a given date (if no date is given, today's date is used).
